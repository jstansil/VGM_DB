# VGM_DB
Database Systems 2022 Final Project

Find an extremely slow, buggy version on Google App Engine here: https://vgm-app-372421.ue.r.appspot.com/ (it probably doesn't work). Works fine when deployed locally, however.

To run this locally, import the packages in requirements.txt and run main.py. Please note that the final line of this script should be removed to be deployed elsewhere.
